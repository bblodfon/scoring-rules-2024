<p>We benchmark the two versions of the survival brier score <span class="citation" data-cites="Graf1999">(<a href="#ref-Graf1999" role="doc-biblioref">Graf et al. 1999</a>)</span>, namely the <strong>Integrated Survival Brier Score (ISBS)</strong> and the proposed <strong>we-weighted version (RISBS)</strong> (see <a href="https://mlr3proba.mlr-org.com/reference/mlr_measures_surv.graf.html#details">documentation details</a> for their respective formulas). The first (ISBS) is not a proper scoring rule <span class="citation" data-cites="Rindt2022">(<a href="#ref-Rindt2022" role="doc-biblioref">Rindt et al. 2022</a>)</span>, the second (RISBS) is <span class="citation" data-cites="Sonabend2022">(<a href="#ref-Sonabend2022" role="doc-biblioref">Sonabend 2022</a>)</span>. Our goal is to assess whether these scores exhibit differences in simulated and real-world datasets, and if so, to understand the reasons behind these differences.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>For each simulated dataset, we performed a simple train/test resampling (70%/30%). Each resampling was stratified using the <code>status</code> variable so that the proportion of censoring remains the same in each respective train and test set.</p>
<p>We trained 3 models in each respective train set, namely the <strong>Kaplan-Meier</strong>, the <strong>Cox Proportional Hazards</strong> (CoxPH) model and an <strong>Accelerated Failure Time</strong> (AFT) model with Weibull distribution for the time-to-event output variable. We tested the performance of each model in each respective test set using the <strong>ISBS</strong> and <strong>RISBS</strong> measures, integrating up to the <span class="math inline">80\%</span> quantile of the event times of each train set.</p>

<p>We used a total of <span class="math inline">26</span> real-word, low-dimensional datasets (fewer features than observations) for benchmarking, some of which are freely available via various <code>R</code> packages. For each dataset, we performed a simple train/test resampling (80%/20%) <span class="math inline">100</span> times. Each resampling was stratified using the <code>status</code> variable so that the proportion of censoring remains the same in each respective train and test set.</p>
<p>We trained 3 models in each respective train set, namely the <strong>Kaplan-Meier</strong>, the <strong>Cox Proportional Hazards</strong> (CoxPH) model and an <strong>Accelerated Failure Time</strong> (AFT) model with Weibull distribution for the time-to-event output variable. We tested the performance of each model in each respective test set using the <strong>ISBS</strong> and <strong>RISBS</strong> measures, integrating up to the <span class="math inline">80\%</span> quantile of the event times of each train set. We kept also the brier scores for each specific observation (<em>per-observation</em> scores) in all respective test sets.</p>

<p>Note that in the 4 last datasets we have censored observations with <span class="math inline">t &gt; t_{max}</span> so they are excluded from the calculation of the brier scores as we integrate up to the <code>t_max</code> time horizon cutoff. Therefore only observations that have experienced the event contribute to the scores (but the estimation of the censoring distribution using the Kaplan-Meier uses all observations of a train set).</p>

<p>To avoid the inflation of RISBS and generally have a more robust estimation of both RISBS and ISBS scoring rules, we advise to set the <code>t_max</code> argument (time horizon).
